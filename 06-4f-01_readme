Intel Broadwell-EP/EX (BDX-ML B/M/R0, family 6, model 79, stepping 1) has issues
with microcode update that may lead to a system hang; while some changes
to the Linux kernel have been made in an attempt to address these issues,
they were not eliminated, so a possibility of unstable system behaviour
after a microcode update performed on a running system is still present even
on a kernels that contain aforementioned changes.  As a result, microcode update
for this CPU model has been disabled by default.

For the reference, kernel versions for the respective RHEL minor versions
that contain the aforementioned changes, are listed below:
 * Upstream/RHEL 8: kernel-4.17.0 or newer;
 * RHEL 7.6 onwards: kernel-3.10.0-894 or newer;
 * RHEL 7.5.z: kernel-3.10.0-862.6.1 or newer;
 * RHEL 7.4.z: kernel-3.10.0-693.35.1 or newer;
 * RHEL 7.3.z: kernel-3.10.0-514.52.1 or newer;
 * RHEL 7.2.z: kernel-3.10.0-327.70.1 or newer.
 * RHEL 6.10.z: kernel 2.6.32-754.1.1
 * RHEL 6.7.z: kernel 2.6.32-573.58.1
 * RHEL 6.6.z: kernel 2.6.32-504.71.1
 * RHEL 6.5.z: kernel 2.6.32-431.90.1
 * RHEL 6.4.z: kernel 2.6.32-358.90.1

Please contact you system vendor for a BIOS/firmware update that contains
the latest microcode version. For the information regarding microcode versions
required for mitigating specific side-channel cache attacks, please refer
to the following knowledge base articles:

 * CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646 ("L1 Terminal Fault Attack"):
   https://access.redhat.com/articles/3562741
 * CVE-2018-12130, CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127, and CVE-2019-11091

The information regarding enforcing microcode load is provided below.

For enforcing using of this microcode for a specific kernel, please create
a file "force-late-intel-06-4f-01" inside /lib/firmware/<kernel_version>
directory:

    mkdir -p /lib/firmware/2.6.32-754.1.1
    touch /lib/firmware/2.6.32-754.1.1/force-late-intel-06-4f-01

After that, it is possible to perform a microcode update by executing
"/usr/libexec/microcode_ctl/reload_microcode".

For enforcing usage of this microcode on all kernels, please create a file
"/etc/microcode_ctl/ucode_with_caveats/force-late-intel-06-4f-01":

    mkdir -p /etc/microcode_ctl/ucode_with_caveats
    touch /etc/microcode_ctl/ucode_with_caveats/force-late-intel-06-4f-01

Please refer to /usr/share/doc/microcode_ctl/README.caveats for additional
information.
