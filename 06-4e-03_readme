Some Intel Skylake CPU models (SKL-U/Y, family 6, model 78, stepping 3)
have reports of system hangs when revision 0xdc of microcode, that is included
since microcode-20200609 update to address CVE-2020-0543, CVE-2020-0548,
and CVE-2020-0549, is applied[1].  In order to address this, microcode update
to the newer revision has been disabled by default on these systems,
and the previously published microcode revision 0xd6 is used by default
for the OS-driven microcode update.

The information regarding enforcing microcode update is provided below.

To enforce usage of the latest 06-4e-03 microcode revision for a specific kernel
version, please create a file "force-intel-06-4e-03" inside
/lib/firmware/<kernel_version> directory:

    mkdir -p /lib/firmware/3.10.0-862.9.1/
    touch /lib/firmware/3.10.0-862.9.1/force-intel-06-4e-03

After that, it is possible to perform a late microcode update by executing
"/usr/libexec/microcode_ctl/reload_microcode".

To enforce addition of this microcode for all kernels, please create file
"/etc/microcode_ctl/ucode_with_caveats/force-intel-06-4e-03":

    mkdir -p /etc/microcode_ctl/ucode_with_caveats
    touch /etc/microcode_ctl/ucode_with_caveats/force-intel-06-4e-03

Please refer to /usr/share/doc/microcode_ctl/README.caveats for additional
information.
